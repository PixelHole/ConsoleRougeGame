the goal is to create a fully playable game with the visual style similar to early-Dwarf Fortress or Caves of qud, but fully inside the windows console.
planned mechanics:
- building system
- survival mechanics
  - huger and thirst
  - hunting for food, growing crops
  - crafting and upgrading tools
- combat system
- Randomly generated world
